Data Analysis with SQL and Data Storytelling
BOOTCAMP PROJECT CHALLENGE RESULTS: BRADESCO: GENAI and DATA (Accelerate Your Learning with AI: Explore the Power of NotebookLM)

This repository documents an authorial study conducted with the support of NotebookLM, in which I actively participated in source curation (including technical books), defining the study methodology, and requesting educational artifacts such as flashcards, slides, and mind maps to consolidate learning.

The focus of the study is to understand how Data Analysis with SQL, combined with Data Storytelling, directly impacts the way analytical results are understood and used in decision-making.

🔗 NotebookLM used in the study:

🎯 Study Objective

Analyze the role of SQL in generating analytical insights.
Investigate how storytelling influences the presentation and interpretation of data.
Demonstrate that effective analysis goes beyond technical execution.
Consolidate learning through multiple educational formats.
🛠️ Tools and Technologies

SQL – queries, analysis, and insight extraction.
NotebookLM – source analysis, knowledge synthesis, and study material generation
Markdown – structured documentation
GitHub – versioning and technical portfolio
📚 Source Curation

I curated the sources manually, prioritizing technical and reliable content, including:

Books on data analysis and visualization
Materials on SQL and data-driven decision making
Content on storytelling applied to data
Book: Storytelling with Data; Advanced Database / Simone Cristina Aléssio. Indaial: UNIASSELVI, 2015 -Handbook: Introduction to SQL by Prof. Edberto Ferneda and Introduction to SQL by Jair Daum Franceschin.
The selected sources were uploaded to NotebookLM for cross-analysis, synthesis, and extraction of key concepts.

🧠 Study Methodology

Active curation of sources (books, articles, and technical materials)
Organization and upload of sources to NotebookLM
Definition of guiding questions for the study
Generation of flashcards for memorizing concepts
Creation of slides to structure the narrative
Development of mind maps for a systemic view
Consolidation of learning in technical documentation
❓ Key Questions

Why do correct results in SQL not always lead to effective decisions?
How can raw data be transformed into understandable narratives?
What is the impact of storytelling on the presentation of analyses?
How can communication be adapted for technical and non-technical audiences?
📌 Key Study Points

SQL answers questions, storytelling generates understanding SQL is essential for obtaining reliable data, but it is storytelling that connects the results to the context and real impact.

Narrative guides the audience's attention The way data is presented directly influences interpretation and decision-making.

Learning is strengthened with multiple formats Flashcards, slides, and mind maps accelerate the assimilation and retention of technical knowledge.

Data analysis requires technical and communication skills The data analyst acts as a bridge between data, technology, and business.

🚀 Practical Applications

Presentation of SQL analysis results
Analytical and executive reports
Construction of dashboards and presentations
Technical and educational studies in data
📈 Connection with Software Engineering

Use of SQL as a central analysis tool
Organization and documentation of knowledge
Analytical thinking applied to problem solving
Design of study materials as part of technical learning
Does not replace human review, but optimizes the process.

🧠 Final Consideration

This study demonstrates that data analysis does not end with SQL queries. The presentation of results changes everything; there is no point in being technical and unable to communicate insights clearly and strategically, 
whether in a formal or informal presentation. In addition to technical competence, we need to work on building narratives for assertive communication that leads to decision-making.
